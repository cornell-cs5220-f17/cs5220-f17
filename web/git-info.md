We *strongly* encourage you to keep your code in a (private) hosted
Git repository.  This will help you avoid losing your work to
crashed drives and unruly pets, and will also make it easier to keep
code in sync between your laptop and the class cluster.  Possible
options include:

 - [Cornell's Github server](http://github.coecis.cornell.edu/)
 - [GitHub](https://github.com/)
 - [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
 - [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

We will use [CMS] to submit all class homeworks and projects this
semester.  However, for homeworks that include code, you may choose
to use [CMS] *either* to submit a tarball with the code files directly
*or* to submit a pointer to a Git repository that contains your
submission.  If you choose to do the latter, you should use the
following process to make sure that we are able to access the correct
version of your code:

1.  Change to your project directory on the cluster.

2.  Run `submit-repo.sh [remote]` where `[remote]` denotes the name
    of the remote repository you are using.  By default this will be
    `origin`.  Once this has run, you will have created a `submission`
    tag on the remote server, and a file `repo.txt` locally that you
    should submit.
    
3.  The `submit-repo.sh` script will also print an SSH public key when
    it finishes running; add the generated public key as a "deployment
    key" or "access key" with permission to read the repository
    (read-only should be the default).  Directions for how to do this
    under
    [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/),
    [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-access-keys-294486051.html),
    and
    [GitLab](https://support.deployhq.com/articles/repositories/adding-a-new-deployment-key-to-gitlab)
    are available online.
    
    Adding this key will give us read access, thereby allowing us to
    properly look at your repository.  No key means no access on our
    side!

4.  In CMS, submit the generated `repo.txt` file as part of your submission.

If you would like the professor or the TA to be able to comment on
your code independent of the submission process, you can always add us
to your repository as regular collaborators with read-only access.  We
are `dsb253` and `ehl59` on the Cornell GitHub, and `dbindel` and
`ericlee0803` on GitHub and Bitbucket (and GitLab in the case of the
professor).
